# Builder Pattern

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction processes 
can create different representations.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
